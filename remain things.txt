remaining things
- register table floating representation 
- la is not working in the pipeline (need to check).
- need to check the floating functions ( jd ) 
- if time allocates we need to make animation of to show the page which updates in data segment 

.float - for integer to give
ld and store is working fine
fadd all fsub and mul and div are working fine
fmv - from floating to int checked 
fcvt - from floating to int checked

when we assemble floating registers are not resetting(resolved) 

1)change of register update not checking values instead make emit signal from the backend to frontend to highlight the register row.
2) hex of showing different
3) highlight datasegment and block pages for it.
